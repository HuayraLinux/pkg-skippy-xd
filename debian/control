Description: Full-screen Exposé-style standalone task switcher for X11.
 Skippy-XD is a full-screen task-switcher for X11. You know that thing
 Mac OS X, Compiz and KWin do where you press a hotkey and suddenly you
 see miniature versions of all your windows at once? Skippy-XD does just
 that. It's most commonly known by Mac OS X's name for it - Exposé.
